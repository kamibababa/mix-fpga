Dear Mr. Knuth,

on your homepage I found links related to MIXware. On the bottom of the
list you ask:

"(Please let me know of any other sites that I should add to this
list.)"

And here it is: https://gitlab.com/x653/mix-fpga

It's my git repository, where I present a way to build a real MIX
computer based on a little fpga-board. Even if MIX is "quite obsolete",
it's real fun to run the mixal programs on real hardware. So MIX is not
mythical anymore, as stated in TAOCP Vol.1 1.3.

Everybody can follow the guidelines presented in my repository and
build their own MIX. All commands described in TAOCP 1.3 except
floating point arithmetic are implemented following the exact timing
specifications. (Even the fancy SRC/SLC commands, which need a modulo
10 computation execute in the requested two cycles).

All character based in-/output units (U16-U20) are connected to a USB-
port (115200 baud 8N1), so you can connect to MIX with a PC to upload
your mixal programs.

Everything is ready for production. So in case you want to have a real
MIX computer, I would like to offer you the following barter trade:

- I send you a signed MIX-computer (you can choose the color of the
case: red, blue or gray)

and

- You send me a signed copy of your book "The Art of Computer
Programming Vol. 1"

How does this sound?

Best regards

Michael Schröder

Deal. Tell me which color of ink you prefer.

(And when you do MMIX, I'll do the same with Volume 1 Fascicle 1,
plus Volume 4A, plus the MMIX volume from LNCS.)

And by the way, congratulations on the evident success of this project.

PS Do you have the GO-button (exercise 1.3.1--26)? [There's an in-joke
about this: The index refers to page 126, where there's something
next to the Overflow toggle that looks like a button.]

PPS oops I see you have indeed anticipated the GO button
