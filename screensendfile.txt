Hopefully you have already solved this problem yourself, but I'll answer in case anyone else have the same problem.

GNU screen has a command called readreg which you can use to read a file into a register. After a register is filled with data you can paste that data using the paste command.
Inside screen

Inside screen you press Ctr + a and then : to execute a command. Then you simply write and press enter:

readreg p /path/to/thefile

After you have executed the command you should se a message saying Slurped X character into buffer.

You can then paste the data in that buffer by again pressing Ctr + a and then :, then write and press enter:

paste p

Note: p is the name of the register

And you're done.
